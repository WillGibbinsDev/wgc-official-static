          Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within 1
          day of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be
          entertained if the orders have already been communicated to the
          sellers/merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated the
          shipping process, or the product is out for delivery. In such an
          event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.

          9778226340 does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items
          like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund or replacement can be
          considered if the user establishes that the quality of the product
          delivered is not satisfactory.
